            <p> A rhinoceros (/raɪˈnɒsərəs/, from Greek rhinokerōs 'nose-horned', from rhis 'nose', and keras 'horn'),
                commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of any of the five extant species (or numerous extinct
                species) of odd-toed
                ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae. (It can also refer to a member of any of the extinct species of
                the
                superfamily Rhinocerotoidea.) Two of the extant species are native to Africa, and three to South and
                Southeast Asia.

            <p> Rhinoceroses are some of the largest remaining megafauna: all weigh at least one tonne in adulthood.
                They have a herbivorous diet, small brains (400–600 g) for mammals of their size, one or two horns,
                and a thick (1.5–5 cm), protective skin formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice
                structure. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut
                allows them
                to subsist on more fibrous plant matter when necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African
                species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths; they rely instead on their lips to pluck
                food.
            </p>
            <p> Rhinoceros are killed by poachers for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market for
                high prices, leading to most living rhinoceros species being considered endangered.
                The contemporary market for rhino horn is overwhelmingly driven by China and Vietnam, where it is
                bought by wealthy consumers to use in traditional Chinese medicine, among other uses. Rhino horns
                are made of keratin, the same material as hair and fingernails, and there is no good evidence of any
                health benefits.[2][3][4] A market also exists for rhino horn dagger handles in Yemen, which was the
                major source of demand for rhino horn in the 1970s and 1980s.

                A subspecific hybrid white rhino (Ceratotherium s. simum × C. s. cottoni) was bred at the Dvůr Králové Zoo (Zoological Garden Dvur Kralove nad Labem) in the Czech Republic in 1977. Interspecific hybridisation of black and white rhinoceros has also been confirmed.[9]

                While the black rhinoceros has 84 chromosomes (diploid number, 2N, per cell), all other rhinoceros species have 82 chromosomes. However, chromosomal polymorphism might lead to varying chromosome counts. For instance, in a study there were three northern white rhinoceroses with 81 chromosomes.[10]
